# kc-prime

Website developed for restaurant KC Prime. Worked on getting it responsive with all device sizes. Highlighted menu items with flippable cards: one side with picture of dish, other side with ingredients. Attempted to make a more modern design than current website. Also incorporated VIP-email list.
